The activity involves setting up a store that must organize the sale of fresh products (fruit, vegetables, dairy products) efficiently to ensure that they are sold in the right order, preventing older foods from expiring before they are sold. 
Through appropriate controls, the FIFO (First In, First Out) method will be used to ensure that older products are sold first and, if close to their expiry date, a 5% discount will be applied.
